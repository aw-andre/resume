I want to work in an environment that makes me think hard; this would most probably involve dealing with a complex problem and being given the agency to come up with and implement solutions to said problem.

I developed a program to parse Paradox Script, a DSL created by Paradox Interactive to code their games, and store the outputted data into a Postgres database. While the script itself was a Turing-complete language, I was able to model assignment and scoping relationships using recursive parent-child relations. This was done in an effort to keep track of every modifier available in Paradox games as there were so many that the wiki could not keep up. As this involved parsing and regenerating millions of rows of data for every game and update, I had to utilize several unorthodox strategies to speed up the program, including dropping indices during insertion and regenerating them, disabling logging on tables, and batching inserts into transactions.
In order to display the data for those who were unfamiliar with databases, I created a web server that would recursively display the parents and children of any modifier that was searched for using HTMX. By properly paramaterizing SQL queries, I was able to protect against injection attacks, and by using a standard format for HTTP requests, I was able to make it so that new games and mods could be added to any hosted web server with a oneline change to the underlying code.
